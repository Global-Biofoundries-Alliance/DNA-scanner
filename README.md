# DNA-scanner

DNA Scanner is a web application to quickly find and compare vendors for synthetic DNA ordering. Users provide sequences in FASTA, Genbank, or SBOL format, and obtain, for each sequence, a comparison of the lead time and pricing of all vendors capable of producing the sequence.

The project is an initiative of the [Global Biofoundry Alliance](https://biofoundries.org/) to streamline the ordering or DNA in large-scale genetic engineering projects.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- The application runs in a docker container, therefore docker and docker-compose must be installed.
- Clone the project from the git repository.
- Add your credentials for the different vendor APIs in the `Backend/config.yml` configuration file.

## Development installation

In the development environment, a database is made available within a container. This is not the case in the production environment, because it is not recommended for production use.

Use the shell script _deploy.sh_ to start the environment. The script will run docker-compose with the _docker-compose.yml_ and it will be extended by the _docker-compose.override.yml_.

```
chmod 775 deploy.sh
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

By default the _./Backend/config.yml_ has the database credentials as configured in the _docker-compose.override.yml_.

By default the volumes of the database are bound to _/srv/dnascanner/db/_ to make the data persistent. You can make the saved information temporary by removing the volume shown below from the _docker-compose.override.yml_.

`- /srv/dnascanner/db:/var/lib/mysql`

### Force Rebuild

You can force a rebuild without caching using the script _rebuild.sh_.

```
chmod 775 rebuild.sh
sudo ./rebuild.sh
```

## Production installation

The production environment requires a separate database. You can configure it in _./Backend/config.yml_. In the production environment the database must be separate because it is not recommend to run a database inside of a container for production use.

Certificates for https are required for the production environment. The certificates must be placed in `/srv/dnascanner/cert/`. In the following code we create the directory and generate self-signed certificates. Alternatively you can put your own certificates there. The certificates are configured in the file _nginx-secure.conf_.

```
mkdir /srv/dnascanner/cert -p
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /srv/dnascanner/cert/cert.key -out /srv/dnascanner/cert/cert.crt
```

The _nginx-secure.conf_ will be used as default. You can also place an specific nginx configuration file in `/srv/dnascanner/nginx/`.

Use the shell script _deploy-prod.sh_ to start the environment. The script will run docker-compose with the _docker-compose.yml_ and it will be extended by the _docker-compose.prod.yml_.

```
chmod 775 deploy-prod.sh
sudo ./deploy-prod.sh
```

# Configuration

Name           | Description
-------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Port           | The default port is 80\. You can change it in the docker-compose.prod.yml. At services > frontend > ports. Just write your port before the ":443".
Mapped folders | The default the folders are mapped into /srv/dnascanner/. You can change it in the docker-compose.prod.yml. At services > frontend > volumes. Just write your path before the ":".
